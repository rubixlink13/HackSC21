# Social Distancing: The Game 
A multiplayer game in which players can catch coronavirus from being in close contact with other players. Their health can be repaired through the purchase of medicines and vaccines, payable in XPR (RippleX). 

Our game is built using the Unity game engine and C# scripts. The main player can be controlled using the arrows on a keyboard, or the equivalent keys of w-a-s-d. The objective of the game is to stay away from, or socially distance from, the other players in the game, noticeable because of the red covid fields surrounding them. Additionally, some green health pills will be available in the scene; coming into contact with one of those pill will increase health, but each pill will disappear after one use. More details can be explored by checking out the game!
